export const NOTES = {
  range_advantage: "IP holds higher top‑pair density on high/dry boards; small bets deny equity efficiently.",
  small_bet_highcard: "On ace/king‑high, small c‑bets perform well with range to leverage range advantage.",
  delayed_range: "After flop checks through, OOP can probe turn on advantaged cards to deny equity.",
  card_favors_oop: "Turn card connects better with OOP range, enabling lead at small/mid sizes.",
  bluffcatch_blockers: "Call more with hands blocking value (e.g., top two/sets) and unblocking missed draws.",
  thin_value_risk: "Thin value raises shrink against polarized ranges; prefer call unless strong blockers.",
  wide_bb_defense: "BB defends wide vs small SB opens; suited/connected hands realize equity well.",

  // Hand-class specific
  hc_top_pair: "Top pair: value bet most turns/rivers unless texture heavily favors opponent; size up when draws present.",
  hc_second_pair: "Second pair: mix; prefer smaller bets or checks without redraws, call vs aggression with good kickers.",
  hc_weak_pair: "Weak pair: protect selectively; check more often unless bet denies significant equity.",
  hc_overcards: "Two overcards: good candidates to bet when equity/realization improves, esp. with backdoor flush/straight.",
  hc_bdfd: "Backdoor flush: small bets gain equity on many turns; continue on suited or straight‑improving cards.",

  hc_gutshot: "Gutshot: mix; prefer betting with overcards/backdoors, otherwise check.",
